Will require Unity to open as a game

The end product should be a game where two players play 'Rock Paper Scissors' and then fight each other as either Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

At its current state, it only has the groundwork of a game, but I took great effort to make sure everything is easily customizable and expandable to make it much easier to add to in the future.
