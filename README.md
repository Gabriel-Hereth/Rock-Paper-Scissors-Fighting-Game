Will probably require Unity to open

The end product should be a game where two players play 'Rock Paper Scissors', and then fight each other as either Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

At its current state, it only has the groundworks for the game, but I took great effort to make sure everything is easily customizable and expandable to make it much easier to add to the game.

I had to hide the library file because it took up too much space, so if you use the files in Unity you won't have any assets
